## Introduction

Welcome to the Computer Vision Experiments repository! This collection of projects aims to explore various aspects of computer vision, including image classification, object detection, image segmentation, and more. Each project is contained within its own directory, complete with detailed documentation and instructions. Planning to update is as I go testing.

## Projects

Intial commit will have testing projects for introduction.

Here's a brief overview of the projects included in this repository: (Planned for later)

1. **Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks**
   - Implementing image classification using CNN architectures like ResNet, VGG, or custom models.

2. **Object Detection using YOLOv5**
   - Implementing real-time object detection using the YOLOv5 model.

3. **Semantic Segmentation with DeepLabv3**
   - Performing pixel-level semantic segmentation on images using the DeepLabv3 model.

4. **Face Recognition**
   - Building a face recognition system using OpenCV and deep learning.

## Installation
